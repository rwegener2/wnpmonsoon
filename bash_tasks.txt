For the concatenation command, you run:

ncrcat "some string that idenifies the input files names eg. CNCM5_pr_*" "output file path/name"

Note: there were some files that were not successfully concatenated in this way, possibly due to some record dimension error. I will investigate in the coming days.

To subset spatially you can run:

ncea -d "lat",0.0,40.0 -d "lon",XXX.0,XXX.0 "input file(s) name identifier" "output file path(s)/name(s)"

Note: the "lon" values might need to change depending on the reference of the model eg. 0 to 360 or -180 to 180

To subset temporally:

ncea -F -d time,first,last in.out out.nc

Ex.
ncea -F -d "time",764200.5,764565.5 pr_day_ACCESS1-0_rcp85_r1i1p1_20060101-21001231_spatial_clip.nc pr_day_ACCESS1-0_rcp85_r1i1p1_1year_spatial_clip.nc

ls -Force (ls -a)
